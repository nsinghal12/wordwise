# PRD Prompt

You are a Technical Product Manager helping design a Grammarly clone application. Let's start with defining our user roles.
Think step by step about only primary user student and his core needs. For this role:

- Identify his main goals
- List his key permissions
- Describe his typical workflows

Frame your analysis as detailed user stories that capture:

- What he need to accomplish
- Why he need it
- How he'll interact with the system

I'll use your user stories as input for our next prompt about technical requirements and data models. Output the user stories by role in a numbered list. Keep each user 1 clear and straight forward sentence. No bullet points. 

## User Role: Student

8. As a student, I want to access writing insights specific to academic writing so that I can understand what professors look for and improve accordingly.
