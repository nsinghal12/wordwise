# PRD Prompt

You are a Technical Product Manager helping design a Grammarly clone application. Let's start with defining our user roles.
Think step by step about only primary user content creator and his core needs. For this role:

- Identify his main goals
- List his key permissions
- Describe his typical workflows

Frame your analysis as detailed user stories that capture:

- What he need to accomplish
- Why he need it
- How he'll interact with the system

I'll use your user stories as input for our next prompt about technical requirements and data models. Output the user stories by role in a numbered list. Keep each user 1 clear and straight forward sentence. No bullet points. 

## Primary User Role: Content Creator

1. As a content creator, I want to write blog posts and articles directly in the editor so I can craft original, long-form content efficiently in one place.
2. As a content creator, I want to receive real-time grammar, spelling, and punctuation suggestions so I can improve the quality and correctness of my writing without interrupting my flow.
3. As a content creator, I want to see style and tone suggestions based on my target audience so I can align my writing with the intended voice and purpose.
4. As a content creator, I want to track readability scores and word count as I write so I can meet publication standards and reader expectations.
5. As a content creator, I want to save, organize, and access my past drafts so I can revisit and reuse my work across projects.
6. As a content creator, I want to set the context for my writing (e.g., casual, business, academic) so the suggestions are more tailored to my goals.
7. As a content creator, I want to access synonyms and word improvement options so I can enhance clarity and avoid repetition.
8. As a content creator, I want to export or publish my content in multiple formats (e.g., PDF, Word, Markdown) so I can distribute it across platforms easily.
9. As a content creator, I want to collaborate with editors or peers by sharing content links or inviting comments so I can refine my work through feedback.
10. As a content creator, I want to disable certain types of suggestions (e.g., passive voice warnings) so I can focus on the feedback that matters most to my personal style.

# PRD Prompt

Focus on the top 6 user stories for this role, outline the technical requirements and data models needed for my grammarly clone application using Node.js, firebase database, and firebase for auth. Think step by step about:

- What data models we need to store
- What fields each model requires
- Relationships between models

Frame your response as:

- Data Models with fields and relationships
- Core functionality requirements
- Authorization requirements with Firebase

Keep each requirement focused and implementation-ready. Number your list and use single, clear sentences.

## Hereâ€™s a focused breakdown of the **top 6 user stories** for the **Content Creator** role in your Grammarly clone, with **Node.js backend**, **Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore**, and **Firebase Auth**:

---

### **1. Data Models (with fields and relationships)**

**1.1 User**

* `userId`: string (Firebase UID, primary key)
* `email`: string
* `name`: string
* `role`: string (e.g., "content\_creator")
* `createdAt`: timestamp
* `preferences`: map (e.g., tone, disabled suggestions)
* *Relationship*: A user has many documents.

**1.2 Document**

* `documentId`: string (primary key)
* `userId`: string (foreign key to User)
* `title`: string
* `content`: text
* `createdAt`: timestamp
* `updatedAt`: timestamp
* `readabilityScore`: number
* `wordCount`: number
* `context`: string (e.g., "casual", "academic")
* *Relationship*: Each document belongs to one user.

**1.3 Suggestion**

* `suggestionId`: string (primary key)
* `documentId`: string (foreign key to Document)
* `range`: object {start: number, end: number}
* `type`: string (e.g., grammar, tone, style)
* `originalText`: string
* `suggestedText`: string
* `status`: string (e.g., accepted, ignored)
* *Relationship*: Multiple suggestions belong to one document.

**1.4 FeedbackSession** (optional for tracking user feedback/interactions with suggestions)

* `sessionId`: string (primary key)
* `userId`: string
* `documentId`: string
* `interactions`: array of {suggestionId, action, timestamp}

---

### **2. Core Functionality Requirements**

**2.1** Implement Firebase Auth to allow user registration, login, and session management via JWT.
**2.2** Allow authenticated users to create, update, and delete documents in Firestore under their UID path.
**2.3** Process live document content via API for grammar/style/tone suggestions using Node.js and store the results in `Suggestion`.
**2.4** Store and update document metadata such as word count and readability in the `Document` model on every edit.
**2.5** Enable real-time updates to the editor using Firestore listeners for content and suggestion syncing.
**2.6** Enable users to save preferences for style/tone/disabled suggestions under the `preferences` map in `User`.

---

### **3. Authorization Requirements with Firebase**

**3.1** Only authenticated users (checked via Firebase Auth ID token) can access any document or suggestion.
**3.2** Firestore security rules must ensure users can read/write only documents where `userId == request.auth.uid`.
**3.3** Suggestions must only be readable/writable by the owner of the parent document.
**3.4** Admin users (optional future role) can read all usersâ€™ documents for support or analytics purposes.
**3.5** Use Firebase custom claims if you introduce more roles later (e.g., editor, reviewer).

---

Would you like the API route structure and sample Firestore rules next?


# PRD Prompt

yes 

## Great! Below is the **API route structure** and **sample Firestore security rules** for your **Grammarly clone application**, using **Node.js**, **Firebase Auth**, and **Firestore**.

---

### **1. API Route Structure (Node.js with Express)**

These endpoints assume Firebase Admin SDK is initialized and user auth is verified via middleware.

#### **1.1 Auth**

(Handled by Firebase Client SDK; no backend endpoints needed unless custom claims are used.)

---

#### **1.2 Documents**

**POST /documents**
Create a new document for the authenticated user.
Body: `{ title, content, context }`
Auth required âœ…

**GET /documents**
Get all documents belonging to the authenticated user.
Auth required âœ…

**GET /documents/\:id**
Get a specific document if owned by the user.
Auth required âœ…

**PUT /documents/\:id**
Update a documentâ€™s content, title, or context.
Auth required âœ…

**DELETE /documents/\:id**
Delete a document and all related suggestions.
Auth required âœ…

---

#### **1.3 Suggestions**

**POST /documents/\:id/suggestions**
Process document content and store new suggestions (grammar, tone, etc.).
Body: `{ content }`
Auth required âœ…

**GET /documents/\:id/suggestions**
Fetch all suggestions for a specific document.
Auth required âœ…

**PUT /suggestions/\:suggestionId**
Update status (e.g., accepted, ignored) of a suggestion.
Body: `{ status }`
Auth required âœ…

---

#### **1.4 User Preferences**

**GET /user/preferences**
Get current userâ€™s suggestion settings.
Auth required âœ…

**PUT /user/preferences**
Update suggestion preferences (e.g., disable passive voice suggestions).
Body: `{ preferences: { passiveVoice: false, tone: 'friendly' } }`
Auth required âœ…

---

### **2. Sample Firestore Security Rules**

Assuming this structure:

* `/users/{userId}`
* `/documents/{documentId}`
* `/suggestions/{suggestionId}`

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    match /documents/{documentId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
                         resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }

    match /suggestions/{suggestionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
                         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/documents/$(resource.data.documentId)).data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

> ðŸ”’ *Note*: Firestore doesnâ€™t support complex joins, so ensure each `suggestion` stores `documentId`, and each `document` stores `userId`.
